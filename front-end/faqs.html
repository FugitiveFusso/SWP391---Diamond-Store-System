        </p>
        <p class="details">You can know the right ring size for each finger just by applying the following size
          measurement guide:
        </p>
        <ul class="a">
          <li><b>Step 1:</b> Prepare a piece of paper about 10cm long and 1cm wide. </li>
          <li><b>Step 2:</b> Use a piece of paper to wrap tightly around the ring finger.
          </li>
          <li><b>Step 3:</b> Mark the intersection point (note to mark the area bordering the line).
          </li>
          <li><b>Step 4:</b> Remove and use a ruler to measure the length of the piece of paper according to the mark.
          </li>
          <li><b>Step 5:</b> Take the measurement result and divide it by 3.14. Then compare with the Ring Size Table

          2. Instructions for keeping and preserving beautiful and durable jewelry over time?
        </p>
        <!-- Store properly -->
        <p class="small-method">Store properly:</p>
        <ul class="a">
          <li>Store jewelry in a separate box or soft cloth bag to avoid shocks and scratches.
          </li>
          <li>Separate jewelry pieces separately to avoid collisions and surface damage.
          </li>
          <li>Place the jewelry in a cool, dry location and avoid direct sunlight.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Avoid contact with harmful materials: -->
        <p class="small-method">Avoid contact with harmful materials:
        </p>
        <ul class="a">
          <li>Avoid exposing jewelry to chemicals such as soap, seawater, detergents and other chemicals that can affect
            their durability.
          </li>
          <li>Limit exposure to cosmetics, perfumes, and lotions, as these ingredients can tarnish or affect diamonds
            and other gemstones.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Cleaning recurrent:  -->
        <p class="small-method">Cleaning recurrent:</p>
        <ul class="a">
          <li>Clean your jewelry by gently wiping the surface with warm water and a little mild soap. Use a soft brush
            or soft cloth to clean narrow crevices or small stains.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid using strong detergents or hard brushes, as they can cause scratches or take away the shine and
            shine of the jewelry.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Checking daily -->
        <p class="details">Inspect your jewelry periodically to detect any damage early, such as melted stones, missing
          diamond buttons, or loose clasps. If a problem is detected, quickly take the jewelry to the nearest PNJ store
          for repair.
        </p>

        <!-- 3. Do all... -->
        <p class="method">
          3. Do all diamond and diamond jewelry products at PNJ have inspection certificates?
        </p>
        <p class="details">According to international regulations, diamonds of 4.0 mm or more will have a GIA inspection
          certificate. However, there will be pellets that only have PNJ's inspection certificate. Depending on each
          batch of PNJ imported goods, there will be different inspections. PNJ guarantees that the exchange value of
          PNJ or GIA certified tablets is the same.</p>

          IV. Other questions

        <!-- 1. -->
        <p class="method">
          1. Can purchases at FUJ stores & online sites be engraved for free?
        </p>
        <p class="details">Please share your need to engrave your name on the product when purchasing, the consultant
          will receive your request and assist in engraving your name on the product. However, it depends on the
          properties of the material to decide whether it can be engraved on the product or not.
        </p>
        <p class="details">You can go to the nearest FUJ Store for support.
        </p>

        <!-- 2. -->
        <p class="method">
          2. Where do FUJ diamonds come from?
        </p>
        <p class="details">Diamonds are currently being mined the most in South Africa and on the current market there
          are many importing countries. However, Belgium is the place with the best cutting and grinding standards in
          the world and was chosen by FUJ to import directly, so FUJ's financial invoice represents the true value of
          the product.
