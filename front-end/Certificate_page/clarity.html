            <div class="content">
                <div class="content-title">What Is Diamond Clarity?</div>
                <p>Diamond clarity is the assessment of small imperfections on the surface and within the stone. Surface
                    flaws
                    are called blemishes, while internal defects are known as inclusions. In most cases, a diamond’s
                    beauty is
                    not affected by these in any way since most inclusions can’t be seen with the naked eye. When
                    referring to
                    inclusions, gemologists often use the term “internal characteristics” instead of flaws. Internal
                    characteristics are what give a natural diamond its character. It’s also important to note that
                    diamonds
                    with the fewest and smallest inclusions receive the highest clarity grades—and higher price tags to
                    reflect that.</p>
                <p>Remember, all diamonds are unique, not perfect. They are made underground through enormous pressure
                    and heat.
                    Natural inclusions and blemishes are inevitable. </p>

                <div class="content-title">Quick Clarity Tips</div>
                <p>There are many misconceptions around the clarity of diamonds, including the belief that you need to
                    buy a
                    high clarity grade to avoid seeing imperfections. Another common falsehood is that a higher clarity
                    grade
                    results in more sparkle. Neither of these is true! Here are some tips to get you started on your
                    diamond search: </p>
                <div class="info-list">
                    <li>The term “eye clean” means that the diamond’s inclusions are too small to see without
                        magnification. </li>
                    <li>A good place to start your search and maximize your budget is with Slightly Included (SI) and
                        Very Slightly Included (VS) grades because inclusions will not be readily noticeable
                        without magnification. </li>
                    <li>Diamond shape and size affect clarity. While clarity is less important than a diamond’s cut or
                        color,
                        if you are buying a diamond over one carat or considering certain fancy-shaped diamonds
                        (like an emerald or Asscher cut where flaws are more visible), you may want to spend more for
                        a higher clarity grade.</li>
                    <li> Diamond clarity is an important characteristic that affects a diamond’s beauty. Like all of the
                        4Cs,
                        diamond clarity is an important consideration when buying a diamond. While clarity affects
                        price,
                        there are a number of factors that can help you decide which clarity grade is right for you.
                    </li>
                </div>

                <div class="content-title">Diamond Clarity Spans 6 Categories With A Total Of 11 Clarity Grades</div>
                <p>In 1953, Richard T. Liddicoat and colleagues established the Gemological Institute of America (GIA)
                    diamond grading
                    system and clarity scale. The GIA diamond grading scale is divided into 6 categories and 11 diamond
                    clarity grades. </p>

                <div class="small-detail"> <b>I1, I2, I3 Included Diamonds </b>
                    <br>
                    <li>I clarity diamonds have obvious inclusions that are likely to be visible and impact beauty </li>
                    <li>FUJ does not sell I clarity grade loose diamonds for engagement ring designs </li>
                    <li>FUJ does offer a limited selection of jewelry preset with I1 diamonds </li>
                </div>

                <div class="small-detail"> <b>SI1, SI2 Slightly Included (SI) Diamonds </b>
                    <br>
                    <li> Inclusions are noticeable at 10x magnification </li>
                    <li>If eye clean, SI diamonds are often the best value </li>
                    <li> SI2 inclusions may be detectable to a keen unaided eye, especially when viewed from the side
                    </li>
                </div>

                <div class="small-detail"> <b>VS1, VS2 Very Slightly Included (VS) Diamonds </b>
                    <br>
                    <li>Minor inclusions ranging from difficult (VS1) to somewhat easy (VS2) to see at 10x magnification
                    </li>
                    <li>Great value; Blue Nile’s most popular diamond clarity </li>
                </div>

                <div class="small-detail"> <b>VVS1, VVS2 Very, Very Slightly Included (VVS) Diamonds </b>
                    <br>
                    <li>VVS diamonds have minuscule inclusions that are difficult even for trained eyes to see under 10x
                        magnification </li>
                    <li>VVS clarity is rare and results in an eye clean appearance</li>
                    <li>Characteristics are minuscule and difficult to see under 10x magnification, even to a trained
                        eye</li>
                </div>

                <div class="small-detail"> <b>Internally Flawless (IF) Diamonds </b>
                    <br>
                    <li>Some small surface blemishes may be visible under a microscope on IF diamonds </li>
                    <li>IF diamonds have no inclusions within the stone, only surface characteristics set the grade
                    </li>
                    <li>Visually eye clean </li>
                </div>

                <div class="small-detail"> <b>Flawless (FL) Diamonds </b>
                    <br>
                    <li>No internal or external characteristics </li>
                    <li>Less than 1% of all diamonds are FL clarity </li>
                    <li>A flawless diamond is incredibly rare because it’s nearly impossible to find a diamond 100% free
                        of inclusions </li>
                </div>



                <div class="content-title">The Five Diamond Clarity Factors</div>
                <div class="small-detail"><b>Size: </b> The larger or more noticeable a characteristic,
                    the lower the likely clarity grade. </div>
                <div class="small-detail"><b>Number: </b> This is the number of easily seen characteristics.
                    Having fewer characteristics means a higher clarity grade. </div>
                <div class="small-detail"><b>Position: </b> What is the position of any given characteristic?
                    The location of a characteristic within the diamond anatomy will impact the rating.
                    Is it under the table (most visible) and close to a pavilion? This position turns
                    inclusions into reflectors, which have a bigger impact on the clarity grade.</div>
                <div class="small-detail"><b>Nature: </b> The nature of a diamond characteristic relates to
                    the type of inclusion and its impact on durability. </div>
                <div class="small-detail"><b>Color and relief: </b> Color and relief are essentially a measure
                    of how easily a characteristic is seen, or how much contrast there is between the characteristic
                    and surrounding diamond. </div>


                <div class="content-title">Why SI Diamonds And VS Diamonds Are The Best Value</div>
                <p>While the extremely rare Flawless (FL) or Internally Flawless (IF) diamonds are the highest
                    quality diamond clarity, you may want to consider a diamond that won’t break the bank.
                    For the best value, select a diamond with inclusions that can’t be seen through the crown
                    without magnification (also known as eye clean diamonds), like a diamond with an SI or VS
                    clarity grade. These diamonds are much less expensive and look the same as the higher grades,
                    visually.</p>

                <div class="content-title">The Diamond Clarity Plot</div>
                <p>Diamonds over one carat in size receive a diamond clarity plot alongside their GIA grading report.
                    The diamond clarity plot is a map of a stone’s inclusions, blemishes and characteristics.
                    It will include the factors that impacted the stone’s grading and may show other characteristics
                    as well. The diamond clarity plot accompanies the GIA certification.</p>

                <div class="content-title">Popular Diamond Clarity Grades</div>
                <p>With price points and sparkling stones all along the diamond grading scale,
                    there are many types of diamond grades to choose from. Different shapes and cuts
                    will hide many characteristics. Choosing diamond clarity of SI1 or SI2 is a great
                    starting point for finding beautiful diamonds with minimal inclusions.
                    Our VS (Very Slightly Included) and SI (Slightly Included) diamonds are our most popular choices.
                    These diamond clarity grades can have some inclusions, but many of the inclusions are not easily
                    seen with the unaided eye. Many diamond characteristics can also be hidden by the diamond cut or
                    shape. </p>
