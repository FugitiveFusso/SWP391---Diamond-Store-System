            <div class="content">
                <p>Diamond certification is a process in which trusted experts use a standardized grading system to
                    quantify key qualities of a diamond. This helps diamond shoppers understand how a specific diamond
                    will look, making it easier to purchase the right gemstone without worry.

                    <br><br> Independent certification is how you can be sure that you're getting a quality diamond
                    that’s
                    accurately graded without bias. All Blue Nile loose diamonds are analyzed and graded for quality by
                    the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), one of the most respected and accurate labs in the
                    diamond industry. Additionally, all Astor by Blue Nile™ diamonds are certified for light performance
                    by GemEx, the leader in light measurement.

                <div class="content-title">Understanding Diamond Grading Reports
                </div>
                <p>Diamond grading, also known as diamond certification, helps demystify a diamond’s most important
                    qualities to help buyers make informed decisions. The two main reports issued by the GIA are the
                    Diamond Grading Report and the Diamond Dossier®. And, while similar, there are important
                    distinctions.</p>

                <div class="list-learnMore">
                    <li><b>Diamond Grading Report: </b>Many consider this to be the blueprint of a diamond. Starting
                        with the 4Cs of diamonds – cut, clarity, color, and carat – the report includes precise
                        measurements and shape, as well as a plot or map of the individual diamond inclusions, also
                        known as characteristics. The diamond grading report will also note if the diamond has a girdle
                        inscription, and will describe important characteristics beyond the clarity grade. </li>
                    <br>


                    <li><b>Diamond Dossier®:</b> This dossier offers the same grading information as the Diamond Grading
                        Report, minus the plotted diagram. To prove authenticity, the dossier also includes the laser
                        inscription number on the diamond’s girdle.</li>

                    diamond reports. You’ll find a GIA grading report on the product page of every loose diamond on our
                    website, but you can also download a sample below. Note the GIA diamond chart including the 4Cs, a

                <p><b>All FUJ Diamonds Include A GIA Diamond Grading Report</b></p><br>

                <p>Every loose diamond we sell at Blue Nile has been analyzed and graded by the GIA. Since 1931, this
                    non-profit laboratory has ranked among the most respected in the diamond industry, setting the
                    standards for impartial quality review and education.</p>


                <p><b>Keep in Mind:</b> GIA diamond certification helps buyers understand the quality of the diamond
                    they’re purchasing. This kind of third-party diamond certification ensures that you’re getting a
                    quality stone with transparency for the purchase process. For worry-free diamond selection, choose
                    one that comes with a GIA diamond certificate.</p>
