                    <div class="content-title">How To Measure Ring Size With String, Paper & Ruler</div>
                    <p>If you’re wondering how to measure ring size at home, there are creative steps you can take to
                        find the right fit. When shopping for someone else, the best way to find their ring size is to
                        ask them directly. If you're planning a surprise, get help from friends and family. They can ask
                        without raising any eyebrows. You can also use our ring size print out to measure their existing
                        rings to find their size.</p>
                    <p>
                        There are also several at-home methods you can use to find your ring size or your gift recipient's
                        ring size. These methods require a few simple tools to find the right fit including a piece of
                        string,
                        a ruler, a pen and a piece of paper. The at-home method for how to measure ring size may also
                        require
                        a quick calculation to find the numeric size.
                    </p>

                    <div class="content-title">Measure Your Ring Size With These Steps:</div>
                    <p>1. Wrap string or paper around the base of your finger. </p>
                    <p>2. Mark the point where the ends meet with a pen. </p>
                    <p>3. Measure the string or paper with a ruler (mm) then divide by 3.14 (or Pi) to get the diameter of
                        the ring. </p>
                    <p>4. Pick the closest measurement on the ring size chart to find your ring size.</p>

                    <div class="ring-image">
                        <img src="../images/doni3.webp">
                        <img src="../images/doni1.webp">
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-title">More Ring Sizing Tips</div>
                    <p>1. Measure the inside of another ring that fits using a tape measure and our printable ring sizer.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The ring should fit your finger comfortably: snug enough so it won't fall off, but loose enough
                        to slide over your knuckle with relative ease. </p>
                    <p>3. When the knuckle is bigger than the base of the finger, measure both places and pick a
                        size in between the two. </p>
                    <p>4. Measure your ring size at the end of the day when your fingers are warm. Finger size changes
                        depending on the time of day and the weather, and your fingers are actually smaller in the early
                        morning and in cold weather. Also, keep in mind that fingers on your dominant hand are usually
                        larger. </p>
                    <p>5. Measure 3 to 4 times for more accuracy.</p>

                    <div class="content-title">Which Method is Best for Finding Ring Size?</div>
                    <p>Between printable ring size charts, plastic ring sizers, measuring techniques and assessing
                        existing jewelry, there are many ways to find a ring size. The best technique for finding your
                        ring size or the size of someone you’re looking to gift a ring to is the one that works best
                        for you. For extra accuracy, consider trying a few different sizing techniques and reviewing
                        our printable ring size chart.</p>

                    <div class="content-title">What Happens if I Need Ring Resizing?</div>
                    <p>If you’re measuring your ring size to adjust existing fashion rings, women’s or men’s engagement
                        rings or wedding bands you have in your collection, you may need to increase or decrease the
                        size of your jewelry.</p>
                    <p>To make sure you get the best possible fit, the ring resizing process requires adding or
                        removing small amounts of metal depending on the difference between the size purchased
                        and the new size requested. As a result, your ring may be slightly thicker or thinner
                        after resizing. These tiny changes are often visually imperceptible.</p>
                    <p>Our expert jewelry makers at FUJ adhere to strict quality standards so your resized
                        ring both sparkles, and fits, beautifully. After the band is resized, each ring gets cleaned
                        and polished before being returned to you. </p>

                    <div class="content-title">Rings That Can't Be Resized</div>
                    <p>Some of our ring styles cannot be resized due to their design. In these cases, an icon 
                        will appear on the product detail page under the ring size selection.</p>
                    <p>For example, diamond and gemstone eternity rings with a specific number of gemstones 
                        per finger size, milgrain or ornate bands, silver rings, or rings with alternative 
                        metals such as Tungsten cannot be resized. </p>
                    <p>We are happy to exchange your ring for another ring in the correct size within 30 days 
                        of purchase. It is important to note that should you opt for an exchange, your new ring 
                        may contain fewer or more gemstones, diamonds, or a reduction or increase in precious 
                        metal weight, which may cause an increase or decrease in the price.</p>
